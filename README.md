## paginated-cache

This front-end app displays a set of cards on each page, allows a user to go to the previous or next page and see more cards by clicking on a button, and shows the details of a specific card when a user clicks on it. 

Featuring local cache, this app provides seamless pagination and a loading indication when the page requested is being cached.
